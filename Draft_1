Things I should not say (or Waking up on the other side.)

Hi Emilie,

I'm scared to wrie this. 
I'm scared of what I will write, what I will tell you and perhaps I'm scared of what you will think of me.

But please at the end of reading this dont think bad of me. Please think of my words as positive and know that our friendship has become one of, if not the ost important thing in my life. Im not sure quite how that happened but it unquestionably has. 

Right now, at this moment, Im content to just be in contact with you, to message you, to talk on the phone sometimes, to get a glimpse some times in a VC...these moments make up my life. Always thinking and waiting for the next.

You asked if I was ok if you came to Sydney. The honest answer is absolutely yes, but like I said in a few ways it really scares me, in fact it makes me freeze inside and want to run as far away as I can.

It's kind of dangerous for me though, I'm in complete awe of you (I've said this a number of times before) and everything you do makes my feelings for you stronger. I'm not really sorry to say it at all. You are absolutely amazing to me. Beautiful, kind, compasionate, honest, intellegent, elegent, and lovely in the most wonderous ways.

I have never loved someone as much as I love you. I feel that before I didn't even know these feeling were possible.
This isnt a sexual thing (although sometimes I guess it is) Its more about the companionship and connection. I constantly feel drawn to you. 

Ive been trying to stop these feelings but I feel it's hopeless, I really dont like fighting them. Its the fighting that gives me anxiety, not the feelings themselves. If I let myself fall into them I feel that I am fine, and I felt when you let go and did the same then everything was so wonderful. 


jelousy, because I didnt know if I had you.
