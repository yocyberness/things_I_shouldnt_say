Things I should not say (or Waking up on the other side.)

Hi Emilie,

I'm scared to wrie this. 
I'm scared of what I will write, what I will tell you and perhaps I'm scared of what you will think of me.

Right now, at this moment, Im content to just be in contact with you, to message you, to talk on the phone sometimes, to get a glimpse some times in a VC...

It's kind of dangerous for me though, I'm in complete awe of you (I've said this a number of times before) and every things you do make my feelings for you stronger.

I have never loved someone as much as I love you. I feel that before I didn't even know these feeling were possible.
This isnt a sexual thing (although sometimes I guess it is) Its more about the companionship and connection. I constantly feel drawn to you. 



Ive been trying to stop these feelings but I feel its hopeless, I really dont like fighting them
