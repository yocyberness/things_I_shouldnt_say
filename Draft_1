Things I should not say (or Waking up on the other side.)

Hi Emilie,

I'm scared to wrie this. 
I'm scared of what I will write, what I will tell you and perhaps I'm scared of what you will think of me.

But please at the end of reading this dont think bad of me. Please think of my words as positive and know that our friendship has become one of, if not the ost important thing in my life. Im not sure quite how that happened but it unquestionably has. 

Ive said this before, quite a few times actually, but I really feel that you have woken me up in my life and shown me the light I should be striving for. No matter what I will always be breatful and indebted to you for showing me this path. Its a struggle sometimes to stay heading in the right direction, its new to me after all, but I can already feel the great positive influence on my life.Thank you one million times over.

Right now, at this moment, Im content to just be in contact with you, to message you, to talk on the phone sometimes, to get a glimpse some times in a VC...these moments make up my life. Always thinking and waiting for the next.

You asked if I was OK if you came to Sydney. The honest answer is absolutely yes, but like I said, in a few ways it really scares me, in fact it makes me freeze inside and want to run as far away as I can.

It's the same when I think about moving to Vancouver if you were to stay there, for us to work at the same place at the same time together. Even just be in the same city. It doesnt really matter where it is. Its the most amazing prospect in many ways but Im scared of what it would be for us, of fighting my feelings again.

It's kind of dangerous for me, so easy to fall into it seems. I dont think I'm as strong as you, I know this infact as you are by far the strongest person in may ways that I know.

So here is my problem..

I'm in complete awe of you (I've said this a number of times before) and everything you do makes my feelings for you stronger. I'm not really sorry to say it at all. You are absolutely amazing to me. Beautiful, kind, compasionate, honest, intellegent, elegent, and lovely in the most wonderous ways. I said you deverve the world and I'd be happy to try to give it to you.

I have never loved someone as much as I love you. I feel that before I didn't even know these feeling were possible.
This isnt a sexual thing (although sometimes I guess it is) it's more about the companionship and connection. I constantly feel drawn to you. So deeply its prodound. Before I think it was you that mentioned sould mates. I still feel the same, so onected in someway that it often scares me, but in a good way. 

Ive been trying to stop these feelings but I feel it's hopeless, I really dont like fighting them. Its the fighting that gives me anxiety, not you or the feelings themselves. If I let myself fall into them I feel that I am fine, and I felt when you let go and did the same then everything was so wonderful. 

Im not realy willing to give up on something or someone that feels so right. I feel I would be cheating myself if I did. I know I would regret it for the rest of my life and Im very sure that nothing will ever match it again.

I know right now you have so so so much to deal with, I completely understand that. So I keep telling myself that I should give you space and wait. And thats where I get a little scared.

I'm sure you noticed while I was in Vancouver but I got quite jealous a number of times. I have been thinking about this alot, its really not like me and I have not really felt it before. I think it was because I felt that we were not really together ever in my time there, from the start you said this. I did not know what I ment to you and was scared that some other person could so easily take my place. 

I guess thinking about it now, my realisation is that I was quite selfish at the time. But because you had not said any different, I felt that you would slip away so easily. To run back to Igor... to say you now love Jacky... to marry Christian... or some other off hand comment. It tore me up inside because I was so scared that you would leave me alone, that I was not as important as the others, that I didnt matter or that I came last. Its so strange.

This is why Im terrified if you come here or I go there. Im scared of those jealous feelings. If you found a new boyfriend (which you should have every right to do) I would be completly shattered. It would completely destroy me right now. Im scared of you not wanting me but being so close. Im scared of fighting the feeling again. 

So two things:
1) The fear seeing that I haave lost you.
2) The fear of ccontinually havving to fight my own feelings.

I guess the crux of it is that not only have my feelings not changed, but they keep getting stronger. Im not sure what really my hopes or dreams are.

If you asked me to come to Vancouver to be together, and you were serious about it I would ccome tonight. I like really honestly would.

jelousy, because I didnt know if I had you.

william. I could never live up to him. I dont want to.

igor

you are so strong

I feel that all the pain and hurt was from fighting ourselves. 

maybe not a good time to do what we did. for both of us. but I dont think that means it was wrong.

I still have hope. not for right now. Im ok to wait. Im just scared of getting more hurt, boyfriend.


its not you leading me on, its a feeling of connection Ive never felt before
